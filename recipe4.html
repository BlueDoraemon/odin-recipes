        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raspberry jam</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until it's light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Gradually add in the flour, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll it out to 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Use a circular cookie cutter to cut out biscuits from the dough. Then, using a smaller circular cutter, cut out the centers of half of the biscuits.</li>
            <li> Place the biscuits onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake them for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the biscuits from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once the biscuits have cooled, spread a spoonful of raspberry jam onto the whole biscuits.</li>
            <li>Top each jam-covered biscuit with a biscuit with a hole in the center to create the classic Jammie Dodgers sandwich.</li>
        </ol>
