            <li>1 package (10 oz) mini marshmallows</li>
            <li>6 cups crispy rice cereal</li>
            <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 tsp vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>Black decorating gel</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the mini marshmallows to the pot and stir until completely melted and well combined.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the crispy rice cereal until it's evenly coated with the marshmallow mixture.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray and pour the cereal mixture into the dish.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula or your hands (be careful, it might be hot!) to press the cereal mixture evenly into the dish.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture cool for about 30 minutes until it's firm and set.</li>
            <li>Use a cookie cutter or knife to cut out Adipose shapes from the cereal treats. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt the white chocolate chips and vegetable shortening in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval until completely melted and smooth.</li>
            <li>Dip each Adipose shape into the melted white chocolate and use a fork to gently shake off any excess chocolate.</li>
            <li>Place the Adipose on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let them cool and harden for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Use the black decorating gel to add the Adipose's features, such as the eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your Adipose Marshmallow Treats, and don't blink or you might miss them!</li>
