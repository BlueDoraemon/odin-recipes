This project is a part of The Odin Project, which is an open-source curriculum for web development. It is a great way for me to practice my skills in web development by creating a website that showcases Doctor Who themed recipes.

The website I will be creating will feature five Doctor Who inspired recipes. 

The first recipe is Fish Fingers and Custard, which is the signature dish of the Eleventh Doctor. The second recipe is Jammie Dodgers, which is a classic British biscuit that has appeared in several episodes of Doctor Who.

For dessert, I will be baking a Dalek Cake, which is a cake in the shape of the Doctor's arch-nemesis. The fourth recipe is Time Lord Tea, which is the Doctor's favorite beverage with a unique flavor blend. Finally, I will be making Adipose Marshmallow Treats, which is the cute and cuddly alien race that appeared in a few episodes.

By creating this website, I can demonstrate my knowledge of web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will be a fun and engaging project for me to work on, and I am excited to see the final result.
