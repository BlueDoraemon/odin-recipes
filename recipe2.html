            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>

            <li>Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the coated fish fingers to the skillet and fry them for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they're golden brown and crispy.</li>
